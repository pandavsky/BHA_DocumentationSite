# Sake Song Yeast

## Encoding a Traditional Sake Song to DNA sequence

First post on my Github Jekyll page on the first day of the BioHack Academy

###Background###

* Traditional Sake Brewing songs are work songs when sake is brewed.
In 17th century, Sake brewers sang these songs to check a long process of brewing, and also　to keep good rhythm of teamwork etc… 
* In 20th century, brewing technology has been advanced, and brewing process are reduced, so these sake brewing songs are gradually forgotten.
* Those songs were passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. So, I started to think how those songs can be brought down to posterity.

###Objectives###

**Finding the ways;**
- to encode music to DNA sequence

**Exploring scenarios;**
-How does the sake song yeast work?
-Designing products used Sake song yeast 


###Process###

1.Understanding characteristics of sake yeasts (Culturing and Isolating yeasts from sake lees)
2.Researching existing algorithms of DNA > Music 
3.Encoding short Music phrase to DNA sequence
4.Exploring the scenario and/or products based on findings from the above process 1, 2 and 3.
