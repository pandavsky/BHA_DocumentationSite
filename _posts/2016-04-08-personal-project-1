# Sake Song Yeast

## Encoding a Traditional Sake Song to DNA sequence

First post on my Github Jekyll page on the first day of the BioHack Academy

**Background**

Traditional Sake Brewing songs are work songs when sake is brewed.
In 17th century, Sake brewers sang these songs to check a long process of brewing, and also　to keep good rhythm of teamwork etc… 
In 20th century, brewing technology has been advanced, and brewing process are reduced, so these sake brewing songs are gradually forgotten.
Those songs were passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. So, I started to think how those songs can be brought down to posterity.
